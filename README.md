# **UFO**

The UFO program is another creative iteration of the classic "[Hangman](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hangman_(game))" game. This training project, prepared by [Codecademy](https://www.codecademy.com/learn/learn-c-plus-plus), has been an invaluable exercise in exploring the implementation of writing functions while considering scope and flexibility.

## Project Prompt

It’s game time! And by that we mean, it’s time for you to roll up your sleeves and build a game: UFO.

![ufo abduction](./resources/img/UFO.gif)

The premise:

Invaders from outer space have arrived and are abducting humans using tractor beams. Players must crack the codeword to stop the abduction!

Ok, we’ll admit it’s quite a bit like that classic game, [Hangman](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hangman_(game)), but with a better premise. Plus, building this command-line game was the Codecademy 2019 Software Engineer Internship Backend Programming Challenge!

## Technologies

- C++

## Setup

Generally, you would want to compile and execute the program locally. To do that:

1. Download `ufo.cpp`.
2. Open the terminal or command line and navigate to the directory where the downloaded file resides.
3. Run the following commands to compile and execute the program:

### Command Line / Bash

```git
g++ ufo.cpp ufo_functions.cpp -o ufo
./ufo
```

### Command Prompt

```git
g++ ufo.cpp ufo_functions.cpp -o ufo
ufo.exe
```

## Sources

The techniques utilized was based on the lessons taught in [Codecademy's Learn C++ Course](https://www.codecademy.com/learn/learn-c-plus-plus
). The challenge is also provided by Codecademy.
